# Domain Mapping Monte Carlo (Skeleton Repo)

A redacted version of my thesis project exploring Monte Carlo methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in conformally mapped domains. This repository outlines the modular simulation architecture used for domain-mapped Monte Carlo solvers, including geometric reflection logic and simulation pipeline orchestration. Core numerical methods have been redacted for intellectual property reasons but full documentation and structure remain to highlight reproducibility, HPC readiness, and multi-domain adaptability.

## Features

- Conformal mapping strategy for solving PDEs in complex domains
- Modular architecture supporting multiple geometries and parameter sets
- Reflection logic for 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8-plane simulations
- SLURM-ready batch execution for HPC scaling
- Code structured for clarity, extensibility, and reproducibility
- Public-safe: all sensitive numerical code removed, safe for sharing
